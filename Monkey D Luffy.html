  <p1>Monkey D. Luffy, also known as "Straw Hat Luffy" or simply "Straw Hat" ("Straw Hat"), is the protagonist of the One Piece anime and manga series. The founder captain of the Straw Hat Pirates, and one of the top four fighters.</p1>
  <br>
  <p2>His dream is to become the Pirate King and find the legendary One Piece treasure left by the late Pirate King Gol D. Roger. He believes that becoming the Pirate King will make him the freest man in the world. He ate the Devil Fruit rubber
    rubber fruit and gained the ability to stretch his body like rubber. Following his invasion of Totland and his actions against the Four Emperors Big Mom, he is now considered the Fifth Emperor by the world's press.</p2>
    <br>
  <h2>Appereance</h2>
  <p3>He  usually wears short blue shorts, a red vest and sandals. Luffy also has two old scars under his left eye and cut himself with a knife in his first chapter to Shanks that he is brave, painless and has short black hair. I proved it. Sakazuki was seriously injured in the Battle of Marineford, leaving an X-shaped scar on his chest. He looks pretty thin when wearing a shirt, but his muscles are very well developed, as seen in many battles. Even before the time skip, Luffy was quite small compared to most of the other characters in the story.</p3>
  <h3>Before Timeskip</h3>
  <p4>Like most of the male members of his team, throughout much of the story, Luffy wears similar clothing, unlike the others, especially the female members Nami and Nico Robin, who change clothing frequently. He may change it due to climate change depending on how close he is to an island, but returns to his signature red vest and blue shorts after sailing away from it. It also happens that he changes clothes regardless of the climate, but is limited mainly to only changing her colors or minor details, as, for example, in Thriller Bark and the Sabaody Archipelago.According to Eiichiro Oda, Luffy doesn`t know how to dress stylishly, so he is sometimes advised on how to dress by the four members of his team, <a href="Nami.html">Nami</a>, <a href="Usopp.html">Usopp</a>, <a href="sanji.html">Sanji</a>, and <a href="robin.html">Robin</a>, who have good taste.</p4>

  <br>
  <p5>No matter where Luffy is, he always wears his straw hat. Initially, his hat was very easy to knock off his head, forcing him to put the hat in a safe place or give it to someone for storage, so, while adventuring in Alabasta, Nami sewed an elastic band on it, which prevents the hat from flying off during battles.</p5>
  <br>
  <p6>When Luffy returned to Marineford to pay tribute to those who had died in the war, he had 3D2Y written on his right arm, with 3D being crossed out, symbolizing that the Straw Hat team would not reunite in 3 days (3D) as planned before. meeting with Kuma, and after 2 years (2Y).</p6>
  <h3>After Timeskip</h3>
  <p7>Two years later, it hasn't changed much. Luffy wears a long-sleeved, four-button open cardigan. Behind it is an X-shaped scar (covering most of his chest) received from Admiral Akainu and a yellow belt  around it. His waist is tied. His hair is even longer, grew a little, and trained to make it supple. This can be seen from the fact that his neck is thicker and his deltoids and pectoral muscles are more prominent.</p7>
