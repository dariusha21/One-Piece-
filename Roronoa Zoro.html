  <h1>Roronoa Zoro</h1>
  <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/25/31/39/253139ada044794c33ad3915a591fb1d.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="350">
  <p1>Roronoa Zoro is a former bounty hunter and one of the main protagonists of One Piece.</p1>
  <br>
  <p2>Roronoa Zoro is one of the four strongest members of the crew who first joined the Straw Hat Pirates, and his dream is to become the greatest swordfighter in the world. Many often confused him with the team captain and co-pilot because of his
    great power and restraint, which is very different from Luffy's frivolous attitude. He is also one of the pirates called the "worst generation." His current prize is 320,000,000.</p2>
  <h2>Appereance</h2>
  <p3>Zoro is a muscular young man of medium height with short green hair and slightly tanned skin. His distinguishing feature is three katanas suspended from the haramaki on the right side, allowing him to easily draw his sword with his left hand.
    He has three gold pendant earrings hanging from his left ear. He also has a black bandana, which he ties to his hand and puts on his head only in battles with serious opponents.</p3>
  <h3>Before Timeskip</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>During the Drum Island arc, Zoro was initially shirtless until he stole a dark green parka with a light green belt and white fur on the cuffs, hood, and hem from a man in Wapol's army.</li>
    <li>During the Sabaody Archipelago Arc, Zoro wore an open white shirt with red vertical stripes.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>After Timeskip</h3>
  <p4>After a two-year hiatus, Zoro appears with a new scar on his left eye, which is presumably now blind as it is always closed. The swordsman began to look more muscular, his neck became much thicker and he himself became a little taller, almost
    the same height as <a href="robin.html">Robin</a> (188 cm). He now wears an open dark green robe with a red sash around his waist that holds his swords, and the same black bandanna around his left shoulder. Zoro no longer wears a shirt, but his
    green haramaki is still visible from under his robe.</p4>
