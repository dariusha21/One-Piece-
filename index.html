      <h2>World Setting</h2>
      <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/onepiece/images/4/41/Grand_Line_Infobox.png/revision/latest?cb=20151018134256&path-prefix=ru " alt=" Grand Line" width="500" height="303" align="left">
      <p>The fictional universe of One Piece is populated by both humans and other sentient races such as mermaids,
        fishmen,
        and giants. Various large sea animals,
        called the rulers of the seas,
        live in the seas. In this world,
        there is only one Red Line continent that encircles the planet. Perpendicular to the Red Line is the ocean current of the Grand Line,
        which also encircles the globe. The Red Line and the Grand Line divide the oceans into four: the East Blue is the Eastern Ocean,
        the West Blue is the Western Ocean,
        the North Blue is the Northern Ocean,
        and the South Blue is the Southern Ocean. The Grand Line lies between two belts that separate the Grand Line from four oceans called the Calm Belt.The Calm Belt is almost always completely calm and completely lacking in sea currents,
        as well as many lords of the seas,
        so the easiest and safest way to get to the Grand Line is through one of the four currents on Reverse Mountain to get to the top of the mountain,
        and then go down from the mountain along the fifth stream,
        leading straight to the Grand Line. The Grand Line has an extremely unpredictable climate,
        as the weather there often changes spontaneously. Due to the difference in climatic zones in this course,
        there are four main types of islands according to climatic conditions: summer,
        spring,
        autumn and winter.Since the Grand Line is full of magnetic anomalies,
        a conventional compass is not suitable for navigating this current. To do this,
        there is a special log-pos compass,
        which,
        when staying for some time on one of the islands of the Grand Line,
        tunes in to the magnetic field of the next one. The second half of the Grand Line,
        starting after crossing it with the Red Line,
        is called the "New World"and has a much harsher climate than the first. Those who have traveled to the New World have dubbed the first half of the Grand Line "Paradise"in comparison to it.</p>

      <br>

      <p>The technological progress of this fictional universe is inferior to the modern one and resembles the one that was in Europe in the 17th century, however, there are some analogues of modern technologies there. The function of transmitters is
        performed by snailphones, snaillike animals that, when connected to electrical equipment, can function as telephones, fax machines, cameras, and other devices of this kind. The sky island of Skypiea is home to animals whose shells can store
        sound, wind, images, or the force of impact.In the world of One Piece, there is a currency called "belli" in circulation. In Skypiea, there is another monetary unit called "estula". 1 belli is equal to 10,000 estulas.</p>

      <h2>Political Forces</h2>
      <p>Almost the entire world of One Piece is controlled by the World Government, the main adversary of the series. There are many enemies in the world government. One of the main enemies is the Revolutionary Army fighting it, which has already
        run
        coups in several states. The sea is dominated by three major forces: the Marines, seven great pirates, and four emperors, the first two being under the control of World Government.</p>
      <ul>
        <img src="https://anime-fans.ru/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Morpehi-iz-Van-Pis.jpeg" alt="Marines" width="650" height="300" />
        <li>The Marines are the main military force of the World Government, leading not only piracy but also the fight against various enemies. Marines are found all over the sea, but the majority live in the Grand Line, home to the most powerful
          pirates.</li>

        <li>The Seven Warlords of the Sea are seven powerful pirates employed by the World Government, controlling other pirates around the world and maintaining the balance of the three major powers. In return for cooperation and exemption from the
          Marine Corps, the Great Pirates must give the World Government one tenth of the loot and attack only the pirates. Other pirates look down on them and call them "government hybrids." In fact, the Great Corsair is a privateer of the World
          Government and operates primarily on the Grand Line.</li>

        <li>The Four Emperors of the Seas, in the original version of the anime and manga called the Yonko,are the four strongest pirate captains, each with their own fleet and dominating the territory of the New World. It should be noted that the
          emperors of the sea are not allied with each other.</li>

        <summary>Devil Fruits</summary>
        <p>Devil Fruit is a fruit that gives superpowers those who eat it. They are called "treasures of the sea" and are considered "incarnations of sea demons." Although devil fruits come in a variety of shapes and colors, each fruit has a unique
          swirl shape that distinguishes it from ordinary fruits at a glance. Each Devil Fruit has its own abilities, and each type only exists in one case. Devil Fruit is considered rare and highly valuable. Even fruits of unknown effect are rated
          at
          over
          100,000,000 times.There are three types of Devil Fruits:</p6>

            turn into a prehistoric animal, for example, a dinosaur. The main feature of this type is that these fruits can be "eaten" by an inanimate object.</li>

        <summary>Haki</summary>
        <p>Haki is a force that exists in every living creature in the world of One Piece. Unlike the Devil Fruit, it can be mastered by anyone through long and hard training. With the right use of Haki, even a person who has eaten a Devil Fruit can
          be
          defeated, however, it is worth noting that many strong One Piece characters use both Haki and Devil Fruit. There are three types of Haki, of which only two are available to everyone:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Haki of Observation - A Haki that, when mastered, gives one the ability to foresee the actions of opponents and sense their presence. On the sky island, Skypiea is known as the "mantra".</li>
          <img src="https://i.gifer.com/origin/e2/e2ffc3e709d4d3c376f6d4155bd0777b.gif" alt="" />
          <br>
          <li>Haki of Gain - A Haki that covers the user's body with invisible armor. In addition, if you use it during a strike or pass it through a weapon, you can significantly increase its strength. Using Haki of Gain, even the person who has
            eaten
            a
            Logia-type Devil Fruit can be damaged. </li>
          <img src="https://c.tenor.com/cAZITlWNrfsAAAAC/haki.gif" alt="" />
          <br>
          <li>Royal Haki is a type of Haki that cannot be learned, as it is an innate ability. It is present in one in a million people and allows you to deprive opponents of weak Haki from consciousness with a single glance.</li>
